uhubctl
=======

uhubctl is utility to control USB power per-port on smart USB hubs.
Smart hub is defined as one that implements per-port power switching.

Original idea for this code was inspired by hub-ctrl.c by Niibe Yutaka:

Compatible USB hubs
===================

Note that very few hubs actually support per-port power switching.
Some of them are no longer manufactured and can be hard to find.

This is list of known compatible USB hubs:

This table is by no means complete.
If your hub works with uhubctl, but is not listed above, please report it
by opening new issue at https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl/issues,
so we can add it to supported table. In your report, please provide
exact product model and add output from uhubctl.

Some modern motherboards have built-in root hubs that do support
this feature, but you need to use option `-i` to enable it.


Compiling
=========

This utility was tested to compile and work on Linux
(Ubuntu, Redhat/Fedora/CentOS), FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
It should be possible to compile it for Windows as well -
please report if you succeed in doing that.

First, you need to install library libusb-1.0 (version 1.0.12 or later):

* Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev`
* Redhat: `sudo yum install libusb1-devel`
* MacOSX: `brew install libusb`, or `sudo port install libusb-devel`
* FreeBSD: libusb is included by default
* Windows: TBD?

To compile, simply run `make` - this will generate `uhubctl` binary.

Alternatively, for macOS you can build an executable with homebrew's custom tap:

```
brew tap mvp/uhubctl https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl/
brew install --HEAD uhubctl
```

Usage
=====

You can control the power on a USB port(s) like this:

    uhubctl -a off -p 235

This means operate on default smart hub and turn power off (`-a off`, or `-a 0`)
on ports 2,3,5 (`-p 235`). Supported actions are `off`/`on`/`cycle` (or `0`/`1`/`2`).
`cycle` means turn power off, wait some delay (configurable with `-d`) and turn it back on.

On Linux, you may need to run it with `sudo`, or to configure `udev` USB permissions.

If you have more than one smart USB hub connected, you should choose
specific hub to control using `-l` (location) parameter.
